- **Mobile Responsiveness**: PASS - Responsive design works on mobile devices
- **Theme Toggle**: PASS - Dark/light mode switching functional
- **404 Handling**: PASS - Proper error page for invalid routes

#### 2. **Authentication System** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Signup Form** ✅: Successfully integrates with backend API (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- **Login Form** ✅: Successfully integrates with backend API (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- **Phone Verification** ❌: Uses mock implementation instead of backend API
- **Email Verification** ❌: Uses mock implementation instead of backend API

- **Toast Notifications**: PASS - Success/error messages display correctly
- **Auto-location Detection**: PASS - Country/city auto-detection working

#### 4. **Critical Integration Issues** ❌

**Issue 1: Verification System Not Integrated**
- **Problem**: `verifyPhone()` and `verifyEmail()` functions in auth context use mock implementations
- **Impact**: Users cannot complete real verification flow
- **Evidence**: No backend API calls detected during verification process
- **Location**: `/app/context/auth-context.tsx` lines 276-352

**Issue 2: Home Page Using Mock Data**
- **Problem**: Roommate discovery page uses static mock data instead of real backend users
- **Impact**: Users see fake profiles instead of real potential roommates
- **Evidence**: No API calls to `/api/users` endpoint detected
- **Location**: `/app/app/home/page.tsx` lines 28-139

**Issue 3: Swipe Actions Not Integrated**
- **Problem**: Like/dislike actions don't call backend match APIs
- **Impact**: User preferences not saved, no real matching occurs
- **Evidence**: No API calls to `/api/matches/action` during swipe testing

**Issue 4: Profile Management Not Integrated**
- **Problem**: Profile page doesn't fetch or update real user data
- **Impact**: Profile changes not persisted to backend
- **Evidence**: No API calls to `/api/users/profile` detected

**Issue 5: Matches Page Not Integrated**
- **Problem**: Matches page doesn't fetch real match data from backend
- **Impact**: Users cannot see actual matches
- **Evidence**: No API calls to `/api/matches` detected

### 🔧 TECHNICAL VALIDATION

#### Frontend Architecture
- ✅ Next.js 15.3.5 application running correctly
- ✅ React 18.3.1 with proper component structure
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling working
- ✅ TypeScript configuration functional
- ✅ API client properly configured for backend communication

#### Authentication Flow
- ✅ JWT token handling in API client
- ✅ localStorage integration for auth persistence
- ✅ Protected route system working
- ❌ Verification endpoints not connected to backend
- ❌ Profile update endpoints not connected to backend

#### Data Flow Issues
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured (`REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`)
- ✅ CORS configuration working between frontend/backend
- ❌ Most pages still using mock data instead of real backend data
- ❌ Real-time features not tested (Socket.IO integration unclear)

### 🎯 CRITICAL FINDINGS

| Component | Status | Backend Integration | Issues |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Landing Page | ✅ Working | N/A | None |
| Signup Form | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated | None |
| Login Form | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated | None |
| Phone Verification | ❌ Mock Only | ❌ Not Integrated | Uses mock API calls |
| Email Verification | ❌ Mock Only | ❌ Not Integrated | Uses mock API calls |
| Home/Swipe Page | ✅ UI Working | ❌ Not Integrated | Uses static mock data |
| Profile Page | ✅ UI Working | ❌ Not Integrated | No real data fetching |
| Matches Page | ✅ UI Working | ❌ Not Integrated | No real data fetching |
| Navigation | ✅ Working | N/A | None |
| Mobile UI | ✅ Working | N/A | None |

### 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

1. **Authentication Context Incomplete**: Verification functions need real backend integration
2. **Data Layer Missing**: Most pages need to be connected to fetch real data from backend
3. **Match System Broken**: Swipe actions not persisted to backend database
4. **Profile System Broken**: User profile updates not saved to backend

### 📋 REQUIRED FIXES FOR MAIN AGENT

1. **Update Auth Context**: Replace mock verification functions with real API calls
2. **Integrate Home Page**: Fetch real users from `/api/users` endpoint
3. **Integrate Swipe Actions**: Connect like/dislike to `/api/matches/action`
4. **Integrate Profile Management**: Connect profile updates to `/api/users/profile`
5. **Integrate Matches Display**: Fetch real matches from `/api/matches`

### 🎯 FRONTEND STATUS: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

**Working Components:**
- ✅ UI/UX design and responsiveness
- ✅ Basic authentication (login/signup)
- ✅ Navigation and routing
- ✅ Form validation and error handling

**Broken Components:**
- ❌ Verification system (phone/email)
- ❌ Real user data integration
- ❌ Match system integration
- ❌ Profile management integration

**Frontend Testing Status: CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED** ⚠️
