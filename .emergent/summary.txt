The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a mock-data Next.js frontend-only application into a comprehensive fullstack RoomieSwipe application. The initial phase involved understanding the existing Express.js backend structure and integrating critical third-party services like SendGrid for email, Twilio Verify for SMS, and AWS S3 for file uploads. A major architectural shift was the migration from an initial SQLite database to a production-ready MongoDB Atlas cloud database, requiring extensive backend code refactoring, new models, and route updates. Concurrently, the Next.js frontend was updated to consume real API data, with significant changes to the authentication context and the home page's user discovery logic, including addressing numerous TypeScript errors due to data model mismatches. The primary outstanding issue is a persistent Failed to fetch error during the signup process, which needs immediate attention.

The user's core request was to develop a fullstack RoomieSwipe application, a roommate matching platform that was initially a frontend-only Next.js application using mock data. The problem statement evolved into building and connecting a real backend to make the entire application cohesive.

Explicit requests included:
1.  **Authentication Flow**: Implement real login and registration functionalities for users.
2.  **Roommate Matching System**: Integrate real user data and backend logic for the swipe functionality.
3.  **Third-Party Service Integration**:
    *   Email verification (using SendGrid).
    *   SMS verification (using Twilio).
    *   File uploads to cloud storage (using AWS S3).

During development, an implicit requirement emerged: migrating the database from SQLite to MongoDB Atlas, which was deemed essential for production readiness and scalability. The application now features a robust backend with MongoDB Atlas, integrated authentication and verification services, and S3-based file uploads. The frontend has been updated to connect to these real backend services, specifically for authentication and fetching roommate profiles.

-   **Fullstack Architecture**: Next.js (Frontend), Express.js (Backend), MongoDB (Database)
-   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud), Mongoose ORM, SQLite (Initial, deprecated)
-   **Third-Party Services**: SendGrid (Email), Twilio Verify (SMS), AWS S3 (File Storage)
-   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens),  (password hashing)
-   **Environment Management**:  files,  prefix for Next.js
-   **Process Management**: Supervisor (for  and )
-   **Frontend State Management**: React Context API

The application is structured as a monorepo with separate  (Express.js backend) and root-level Next.js (frontend) directories.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : The main Express.js backend file. It was updated to initialize and connect to MongoDB instead of SQLite, and to use the new MongoDB-based route files.
-   : Contains all critical environment variables for backend services (JWT secret, SendGrid, Twilio, AWS S3, MongoDB Atlas URL). This file was created and updated multiple times with user-provided credentials.
-   : Newly created file to handle the MongoDB connection using Mongoose. Crucial for the database migration.
-   : A new directory housing Mongoose schemas for , , , , , and . This defines the data structure for MongoDB.
-   : Modified to use  for email verification and  (specifically Twilio Verify API) for SMS verification, replacing any mock or previous implementations.
-   : New file implementing the AWS S3 client for file uploads (user profile pictures, apartment images). Handles upload and deletion operations.
-   , , : Newly created route files that implement authentication, user profile management, and roommate matching logic using MongoDB/Mongoose models, replacing the older SQLite-based routes.
-   : Modified to integrate with  for file storage and update  metadata in MongoDB.
-    & : Created for the Next.js frontend to store , ensuring the frontend connects to the backend correctly.
-   : A new client-side utility for making API requests to the backend. It uses  and dynamically determines the backend URL from .
-   : The React context for authentication. Significantly updated to use  for , , , , , , and  instead of mock data.
-   : The main roommate discovery page. Updated to fetch real user data from the backend via  instead of static mock data. Required extensive refactoring to map backend data (, ) to frontend components and remove unsupported fields like .
-   : A new Supervisor configuration file created to properly manage and restart both the Node.js backend () and the Next.js frontend () processes, adapting to the actual project structure.

<pending_tasks>
-   **AWS S3 Permissions**: The  action is currently failing due to insufficient AWS credentials/permissions for the S3 bucket. (Message 182)
-   **Frontend Signup Issue**: A persistent Failed to fetch error occurs during the signup process from the frontend, indicating a connectivity or API call issue specifically for registration. (Message 441)
-   **Phone Verification Service Config Issue**: Minor service configuration issue with phone verification, though it doesn't affect core functionality. (Message 353)

<current_work>
The application, RoomieSwipe, is a fullstack roommate matching platform. The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the backend from SQLite to a production-ready **MongoDB Atlas cloud database**. All core backend functionalities, including user authentication (registration, login), user profile management, roommate matching (like/dislike), and file uploads, now correctly interact with MongoDB Atlas. Third-party integrations for email verification (SendGrid), SMS verification (Twilio Verify), and cloud file storage (AWS S3) have been implemented and configured with the provided API keys.

On the frontend, the Next.js application has been updated to use a new  to communicate with the real backend. The  now handles all authentication flows (login, signup, verification, password reset) via the backend API. The  has been refactored to fetch real user data from the backend, replacing the old mock data, and various TypeScript errors related to data structure mismatches were resolved. Supervisor configurations were updated to correctly manage both the backend and frontend processes.

**Current State Nuances:**
While the backend reports 100% test success and the MongoDB Atlas integration is confirmed, there is a critical outstanding issue. The frontend's signup process consistently throws a Failed to fetch error, as indicated by the most recent user message and previous agent diagnostics. This suggests an issue either with the frontend's specific API call to the registration endpoint or a subtle backend configuration that is preventing this particular interaction from succeeding, despite the backend's general health endpoint working. The AWS S3  permission error is also pending.

<optional_next_step>
My next step will be to debug the persistent Failed to fetch error occurring during the frontend signup process.
